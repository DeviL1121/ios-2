Greetings,

Thank you for your purchase of SpeexKit! Here is your licensed framework that will work with the app with the bundle ID you entered at the time of purchase. When installing this licensed version, please make sure to do the following steps:

1. Remove the demo framework from your app project so you can be sure that your app is linking to your licensed framework after you have dragged it in, and not the demo.
2. Under "build settings" for your project and target, make sure that the setting "Framework Search Paths" does not lead to the demo framework.
3. Make sure that any lines in which you import the framework like this:

#import <SpeexKitDemo/AudioFileWrapperController.h>

now import the licensed version like this:

#import <SpeexKitLicensed/AudioFileWrapperController.h>

i.e. make sure that headers are linked from the version of the framework which does not end with the word "Demo" anywhere that you have imported headers from the demos. Please let me know if you have any difficulty installing your frameworks and I will help you.

Best regards,

Halle
